# Project_Minishell_implementation

Project Description:
This project implements a custom mini-shell in C that mimics basic features of the BASH shell. 
It demonstrates the use of Linux kernel system calls, IPC mechanisms (signals), and handles command execution, piping, and keyboard actions like ctrl+c, ctrl+z.

Technology used:
1.C Language
2.Linux Kernel System Calls
3.IPC mechanism
4.Signals
5.Process

Features:
1.Default Prompt display
2.Customised Prompt
3.Environmental variables
4.External command execution
5.Internal command execution
6.Special variables (echo family)
7.Build in commands execution
8.Signal handling
    1.SIGINT (ctrl+c)
    2.SIGTSTP (ctrl+z)

Documentation:
Built_in_commands.txt – List of supported built-in/internal commands
external_commands.txt – List of supported external Linux commands

Note: The supported internal (built-in) and external commands for this shell are documented in the internal_commands.txt and external_commands.txt files included in the repository.
